# Viral-Read-Detection
using INVADEseq to detect viral reads from scRNA-seq data


pathseq_process.pbs: 
This will process subfolders of the raw_data_folder where cellranger output should be located. Output will take the names of these subfolders.
This script was adapted from cell_culture_samples_GEX_pipeline.sh and uses INVADEseq.py
These files were retrieved from the INVADEseq GitHub: https://github.com/FredHutch/Galeano-Nino-Bullman-Intratumoral-Microbiota_2022/
When using this, please cite the INVADEseq authors: Galeano-Ni√±o et al., Nature 2022
